   <h2>Land of grunge</h2>
   <h3>Seattle is the bomb, right?</h3>
    <p>"We are also the home of Bruce Lee, James Earl Hendrix, and so many others!"
    </p>
    <p>My project concerns the stereotypes and weird tall-tales of the Pacific NorthWest.
  My script is asking three questions using the prompt command that pops up a box.
  I used if/else statements to return statements depending on the answer the user chooses.
    </p>
    <p> My background is in the humanities and thus I am a little nervous about starting up this class. However,
  I am very good at acquiring foreign languages, so perhaps that will help
    </p>
<script>
   var question_one = prompt('Did you grow up in Seattle?');
    if(question_one === "yes") {
    alert("Rainy days make me happy!");
    }
    else {
      alert("I hate the fog!");
  }
   var question_two = prompt("Do you enjoy the rain?");
    if(question_two === "yes") {
      alert("I love splashing in puddles");
    }
    else {
      alert("I hate getting wet!");
    }
    var question_three = prompt("Do you believe in the Sasquatch")
    if (question_three === "yes") {
      alert("I have seen him myself!");
   }
   else {
    alert("I hate conspiracy theories!");
   }
