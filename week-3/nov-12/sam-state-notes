State
+++++

The vote tracker can work by utilizing two states
  1. When the user see pictures to vote on, and the event listeners are listening for a vote
  2. After the user has voted, results are being displayed, and the tracker is awaiting user input to then display 2 new photos

  stateVoting() {
    two new random numbers ()
    display the photos ()
    hide the chart? ()
    turn off or hide the '2 more photos' button ()
  }

  stateResults() {
    tally votes ()
    render the chart ()
    (local storage) ()
    turn off the event listeners on the pictures to prevent further voting ()
    turn on or show the '2 more photos button' ()
  }

  buttonTwoNewPhotos.addEventListener('click', stateVoting);

  picLeft.addEventListener('click', stateResults);
  picRight.addEventListener('click', stateResults);

Another way to manage state

if (voting) {
  thing 1
  thing 2
} else {
  other thing 1
  other thing 2
}

AJ sez: "The ordering of things is the hardest part"
