Having the whole team (Sam, Scott, and the TAs) available for questions in the lab was immensely handy.

The lectures this week were really great. A lot of the gaps in my understanding were filled.

I liked that there were one or two experimentation days where we could just screw around with our code.

This week really emphasized the incremental style of learning of the course. We received a lot of information that built upon itself and created a good picture of the fundamentals of the lessons.

The examples the instructors put up on the 201 repo on Git Hub is awesome. Also the great demos they do in class for us.

Object constructors & event handlers in JS; being forced to deal with a lot of CSS issues, while not enjoyable, was great practice and definitely helpful.

The application process for the next course could have been more clearly stated. I don't know if it should come from the 201 class or perhaps from admissions but I was unaware that I could apply for the 301 before I had passed the 201. So now I'm on a waitlist. I'm also concerned about this now when applying for whichever 401 choose. There are several other people in my class that are going from 201 to 401. Advice on when to apply and perhaps how to choose would be nice.

Not so YAY! comments

I wish we had been introduced to skeleton a little earlier in the week. I incorporated it into my project after I had already written a bunch of CSS so it was a little bit of a pain to rework but I have a feeling that's kind of the nature of working with a client anyway.

The reading.

The course material and the textbook reading did not match up at all this week. It did not detract too much, but it was a little confusing at points.

Reading is kinda blahhh but it is a good reference and gives us a bit of foundation before the class lectures.

I do not find the time we spend going through the book and learning syntax to be helpful at all. We already read the material for homework, so it seems to be redundant and I think that that time would be better spend on actual code. If we must go through book material in class, then I suggest that the instructors use a PowerPoint to extract just the key points from the book, rather than simply scrolling through the PDF on the screen.

The lack of available TA's. There were multiple times this week where there was nobody available for help for around 30 minutes, which was really counterproductive when you can't move past a certain problem with your code.
