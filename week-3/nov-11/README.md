###Refresher on weekly plan:

  * Monday: Start the weekly project! (The interim goal was to randomly display two pictures... did you get that far? Can you tally clicks on them?)
  * Tuesday (pair): Refine the project's look, feel, and functionality; start adding Chart.JS
  * TODAY: Add local storage to your project? Maybe move that to Thursday?
  * Thursday: (pair?): Assigment TBD, depending upon progress Mon-Wed... expect that we'll add some kind of new feature; initial pitches for final projects
  * Friday: discussion on the big picture of web development; last pitches for final projects, set project teams, GO GO GO!
