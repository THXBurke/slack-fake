#Grid Systems Lecture Notes

Grids enable you to build solid structure and form into your designs. Just as with coding, there are recommended ways to organise modules and sections of code, and a grid system can help similarly when designing for the web.

###What the use?
A grid system is a set of measurements a designer or developer can use to align and size objects within the given format. Although there are a few different categories of grid systems, there are no strict rules on what can or cannot be a grid. It's up to you.
