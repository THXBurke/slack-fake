YAY! COMMENTS


I love the dynamic of lecture then practice in lab. Having access to the teachers gets me through the really difficult parts where I would get stuck googling things for six hours. Instead I get a helpful hint that allows me to both work through the problem and understand the problem better.

The lab time working with others was incredibly helpful.

I feel that each time I ask a question in class or for help in the lab that they make sure that they have answered it clearly for me.

The paired programming during lab time is the bomb! Working with another student for the past two days is making a huge difference in helping me get a better understanding of what functions do, how a variable is called and why, as well as other topics which until now I have been struggling with.

'NOT SO YAY' COMMENTS

I struggled with the second day of pair programming because my partner seemed to be really far behind the class. It was tough to find a middle ground.

The reading assignments were not really timed with the lectures all the time, which was kind of weird.

A lot of the lecture this week is getting everyone up to speed on the prework. While that is useful, I am learning less there.

I found the second day of pair programming challenging, as I know so little, it makes it difficult for me to provide feedback to my partner. I felt somewhat useless.

Some of the students in their excitement are skipping ahead. Which is great. I'm all for that. However, it might be nice to mention that keeping their experimentation in a separate project instead of the homework assignment would lessen the amount of time spent in lab fixing something they don't understand yet because we haven't covered it. Especially when your partner is depending on you.
